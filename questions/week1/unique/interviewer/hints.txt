# For any likely questions to be asked (i.e. input/output data types, terminology clarification, edge cases)
Q/A:
* Uppercase and lowercase are separate characters
* Whitespace counts


# Hints to give if interviewee gets stuck or asks for help (i.e. data structures, algos, how to break down the problem)
Hints:
* Try finding a way to remove duplicate characters, this can be done manually or using built in structures. (suggest unordered sets if still struggling)
* Python uses "for character in string" for looping over chars
* "if character not in string" to check if character is already indexed
